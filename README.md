This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom v6 where the catch-all route `/*` overrides other route matches.  The solution shows how to correctly implement catch-all routes to resolve this conflict.  The issue arises from improper route order and incorrect usage of the catch-all route in combination with other specific routes. The solution provides a more robust method that ensures the catch-all route only functions as intended.
